# What did you like about this project?
A very fun and interesting experience overall. Loved trying to develop it further.

# What did you struggle with in this project?
Trying to understand the 2D array concept arr[][] and defining the boundaries of it.

# What would make your experience with this assessment better
It would be fun if the assessment was a group assessment with a more complex game. Maybe a span of one week for the duration. Sort of a mini project.
